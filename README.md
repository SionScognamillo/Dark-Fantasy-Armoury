Introduction:

This dark fantasy armoury project has been inspired by the indie title: Dark and Darker by Ironmace (figure 1,2), which for context is a dungeons and dragons influenced PVPVE dungeon crawler extract videogame. I have plenty experience playing Dark and Darker; and to be given an opportunity to improve my development skills, gain marks for my course as well as pay homage to my favourite game, is simply too good to pass up.

The V1.0 release contains the project equipped with 8 cameras set to render the scene in cycles, to view from camera POV, navigate to the outliner and under the Cameras collection select overview camera and click “0” on your number pad or click the green camera icon in the outliner, if the roof is in the way deselect the white eye symbol next to the roof object in the outliner, from there you can cycle through the camera rendered POV and examine the scene from those angles, feel free to disengage the camera and view the scene at your discretion.

Suggested camera tour rotation:
Overview  Forge  Forge Shelves  Forge Workbench  Armoury Armoury Table  Armour 1  Armour 2.
